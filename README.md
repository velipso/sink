sink
====

Sink is a minimal programming language for embedding small scripts in larger programs, with
TypeScript and C99 implementations.  It is specifically designed to be small, simple, and easily
embeddable, with support for a REPL as used in debug consoles.

**Note: sink is currently in [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta)**
